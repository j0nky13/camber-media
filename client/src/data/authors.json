    "bioHTML": "<p>Bill Rader is an entrepreneur and writer whose work bridges the boardroom and the back-alley workshop. He has built and scaled ventures across industries, collecting both scars and playbooks along the way. In <em>The Venn Effect</em>, he translates those lessons into a usable framework for founders: align what you love with what youâ€™re good at and what the market will pay for. <em>The Gathering</em> marks his pivot into speculative fiction, where the same questions of agency, risk, and systems play out on a global stage. Rader lives and works in Charleston, South Carolina.</p>",
